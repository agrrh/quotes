# Info

Once there was **bash.org.ru**, which later evolved to **bash.im**.

This was UGC-based quotes catalog with rating and some other features.

Few years ago I cloned it using PHP, this attempt resulted in **just_quotes** engine. Sadly, source code was lost long ago.

This repository is another implementation of same idea. Purposes are fun and education.
